## Usage question masquerading as a feature proposal

```
> Is there a way to X? If not, I want that feature.

Hi _____,

Due to limited volunteer time, we can't answer questions like "Is there a way
...". We ask you to do that research yourself, or use [StackOverflow][1]. We can
only accept feature proposals that have already done this research.

Please do come back with a more concrete proposal. Thanks!
